# java-reflection-api-demo

Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods of classes and interfaces at runtime.

The most important classes are Class, Contructor, Field and Method under java.lang.reflect package.

Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods 
of that class which can be executed by using the object.

Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

The output of the demo program is:

com.codes.reflectiondemo.ReflectionTest
com.codes.reflectiondemo.ReflectionTest
